#' demographicModeling.
#'
#' This package provides a number of tools we have found useful in modeling demographic estimations, and other kinds of estimations.
#' This includes one set of functions to calculate, given tibble column names, Della-Carpini & Keeter's political knowledge
#' assessment, the BNT (coming soon), to recode on political ideology (coming soon), and to calculate and recode 
#' other standard measures. 
#' 
#' It includes a set of functions to build and regularize graphs, and third set of functions to simplify running JAGS models 
#' over the kinds of data we typically collect from qualtrics, ipsosMORI, and GSS.
#' 
#' It includes a few other convenience functions (such as gammaFromModeSD) that probably belong elsewhere.
#' 
#' To apply the psychophysical functions we typically apply to these kinds of situations, install dlandy/classicPsychophysics
